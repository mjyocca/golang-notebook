## Concurrency vs. Parallelism

Parallelism:
* Tasks that execute simultaneoulsy and independently from other tasks.
* Requires multiple CPUs.

Concurrency:
* Tasks that execute in any given order in a non-deterministic fashion.
* Achieves multiple tasks by swapping between tasks quickly.

## Goroutines

*Pillar of Concurrency in go.*

### Definition

Independent functions that execute on a set of threads (*"lightweight threads"*) managed by the **Go Runtime**.

The **Go Runtime** schedules goroutines executing them in an efficient way on top of OS threads. The runtime also determines when these goroutines are run.

Can spin up several of thousands of **goroutines** on the same machine.

### Execute a goroutine

Any function can be executed in a separate goroutine.

`go f(x)` where f function and x argument are evaluated in the separate goroutine.


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func add(x, y int) {
  fmt.Println(x + y)
}

func main() {
  go add(1, 1)
}
```

*This example executes the `add(x, y)` in a separate goroutine, sharing the same memory address as the main goroutine.*

*If you were to execute this program, you would not see the computed value of `x + y` to the console with the `fmt.Println` statement.*

After scheduling the `add(x, y)` function to run in a separate goroutine, the **main goroutine** has no other instructions or processes that are blocking so it exits and cleanups any associated resources including the `add(x, y)` goroutine.

If were to block the **main goroutine** with a `time.Sleep(t)` function call after scheduling the `add(x, y)`, it would allow the scheduled goroutine enough time to execute.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func add(x, y int) {
	fmt.Println(x + y)
}

func main() {
	go add(1, 1)
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
// Prints: 2
```

*NOTE: Executing `time.Sleep(t)` to block the main thread is not a production ready pattern. Channels/WaitGroups are though.*


## Detect Race Conditions

### What is a Race Condition

When two or more *goroutines* have conflicting read and write operations on shared resoruces without any locking/ordering mechanisms.

Detecting race conditions is not explicit since the race condition depends on the scheduling of goroutines. Goroutines are non-deterministic, can't determine the order in data is read and written to.

Attempting to write to particular data structures such as a map `map[interface{}]interface{}`, **panics** when reads/writes happen concurrently.

### `-race` Flag

Go toolchain has a built-in race detector, `-race` flag.

Prints out stack traces and any data that read/write that can conflict with each other when a race condition is found.
