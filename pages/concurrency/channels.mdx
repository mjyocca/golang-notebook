## Description

`receive <- [channel] <- send`

Channels allow for sharing data between goroutines in a seamless fashion without passing data between functions directly.

*Channels can also be thought of a **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) queue.*

## Use

### Make a Channel

Create a new channel with the `make(chan interface{})`.

Example: `make(chan struct{})`

*Can also create a channel of channels with* `make(chan chan struct{})`

```go
// unbuffered channel
ch := make(chan string)
// buffered channel
ch := make(chan string, 2)
```

### Send Data `chan<-`

Send value into the channel
```go
// <- arrow points to the chan as data flows into it
ch <- "value"
```

### Receive Data `<-chan`

Receive value from channel
```go
// reads value from channel
// arrow <- points away from the channel
fmt.Println(<-ch)
// assign value read from the channel to a variable
v := <-ch
```

## Behaviors

Types of channels:

* Unbuffered (Synchronous)
* Buffered (Asynchronous)

### Unbuffered Channels (default)

* Channel send (`chan<-`) & receive (`<-chan`) operations are blocking until both sender & receiver are ready (Synchronous communication).
	- Code execution will stop until the send & receive have successfully completed.
	- Unbuffered or zero capacity channels, require both **sender** and **receiver** to be present to successfully complete the operation.

### Buffered Channels

* Channel send (`chan<-`) & receive (`<-chan`) operations are non-blocking until the specified capacity is reached (Asynchronous Communication).
	- Buffered channels have a predefined capacity `make(chan int, 10)`.
	- Up until capacity, the sender can put data onto the channel without blocking.
	- Once a receiver is ready, the value is immediately popped off the queue.
	- Buffered channels can block the goroutine when:
		- If empty, the receiver is blocked until the sender sends a message.
		- If the Buffered channel reaches the predefined capacity and send additional values, the send (`chan<-`) operation will block until values are received (`<-chan`) from the channel.

## Range and Close

A sender can close a channel, to indicate no more messages will be sent. (Only the sender should close the channel)

Receivers can check whether a channel has been closed and that there are no more values to be received by checking the second return value when performing a read operation from the channel.

```go copy
// interface{}, bool
v, ok := <-ch
if !ok {
  fmt.Println("channel is closed")
}
```

Closing channels is not a hard requirement. Only if the receiver needs to be informed that no more values are being sent.

Example, if the receiver is using the `:= range` loop


```go
go func(ch chan string) {
  for i = 0; i <= 10; i++ {
    ch <- fmt.Sprintf("msg: %v", i)
  }
	// done sending to chan
	close(ch)
}(ch)

for i := range ch {
  fmt.Println("Received: ", i)
}
```

## Channel Directions

When passing channels to goroutines & functions, you can specify to the compiler if a channel is bi-directional or uni-directional.

Best practice is to specify if a channel can only send or receive receive messages.

```go
func method(ch chan string) {} // Can send or receive values
func sendOnly(ch <-chan string){} // Send-Only channel
func receiveOnly(ch chan<- string){} // Receive-Only channel
```

## Select

Select lets you wait on multiple channel operations at the same time. Is helpful for reading from multiple channels while also accounting for timeouts / context timeout limits.

A select statement blocks until one of the provided cases are ready, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

Optionally, a default case can be provided to the select statement to continuously execute code if no other cases are ready.

`select` is usually accompanied by a infinite/while `for` loop. Once the first select-case is run, the select statement executes the ready case then exits.

If only reading from one channel, using a for...range loop is preferable.

```go
func main() {
	ch1, ch2 := make(chan string), make(chan string)

	timeout := time.After(5 * time.Second)

	go func(ch chan string) {
		time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1e3)) * time.Millisecond)
		ch <- "message 1"
	}(ch1)

	go func(ch chan string) {
		time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1e3)) * time.Millisecond)
		ch <- "message 2"
	}(ch2)

  // infinite loop
	for {
		select {
		case val := <-ch1:
			fmt.Println("Channel 1: ", val)
		case val := <-ch2:
			fmt.Println("Channel 2: ", val)
		case <-timeout:
			fmt.Println("timeout")
			// return
			return
    default:
			time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)
		}
	}
}
```
